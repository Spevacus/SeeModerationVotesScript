## See Moderation Votes
This script enables anyone to see the current close, reopen, or delete vote count on any question on SE.

Looking at a question will show you the current moderation votes in an italicized button below the post, provided you do not have the ability to see that vote type.

The same applies to Delete and Reopen votes:
